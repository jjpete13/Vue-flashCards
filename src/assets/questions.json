    {
      "question": "What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?",
      "answer": "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to organize and structure code. It is based on the concepts of abstraction encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. OOP allows developers to write reusable and maintainable code, as well as model real-world objects and systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the four main principles of OOP?",
      "answer": "The four main principles of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an object? How is it different from a class?",
      "answer": "An object is an instance of a class. It has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions). A class is a blueprint for creating objects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between an instance and an object?",
      "answer": "An instance is an object that is created from a class. The terms are often used interchangeably, but an instance is a specific object, while an object can refer to any instance of a class."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the advantages of OOP over procedural programming?",
      "answer": "OOP has several advantages over procedural programming, including code reusability, easier maintenance, and the ability to model real-world objects and systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we achieve OOP without classes in C#?",
      "answer": "Yes, OOP can be achieved without classes in C# using structures (structs) and interfaces. However, classes are the most common way to implement OOP in C#. "
    },
    {
      "question": "What is encapsulation? How does it improve software design?",
      "answer": "Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world. It improves software design by allowing developers to change the internal implementation of an object without affecting other parts of the system."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is abstraction in OOP? How does it help?",
      "answer": "Abstraction is the process of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the implementation details. It helps by allowing developers to focus on the important parts of an object without worrying about the implementation details."
    },
    {
      "question": "Explain polymorphism with a real-world example.",
      "answer": "Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. For example, a square can be considered a special type of rectangle, so a method that takes a rectangle as an argument can also take a square as an argument."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is inheritance? How does it work in C#?",
      "answer": "Inheritance is the process of creating a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. In C#, inheritance is implemented using the : keyword."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Object class in C#? Why is it important?",
      "answer": "The Object class is the base class for all objects in C#. It is important because it provides a set of methods that are common to all objects, such as ToString(), Equals(), and GetHashCode()."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key methods of the Object class? (e.g., ToString(), Equals(), GetHashCode())",
      "answer": "The key methods of the Object class are ToString(), Equals(), and GetHashCode()."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does method overriding work in C#?",
      "answer": "Method overriding is a process by which a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass. In C#, method overriding is implemented using the override keyword."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is method overloading? How is it different from overriding?",
      "answer": "Method overloading is a process by which a class provides multiple definitions for a method with the same name but different parameters. It is different from overriding because it does not involve a subclass providing a different implementation of a method."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between early binding and late binding?",
      "answer": "Early binding is the process of binding a method call to a method implementation at compile time. Late binding is the process of binding a method call to a method implementation at runtime. In C#, early binding is used for static methods, while late binding is used for virtual methods."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do virtual, override, and new keywords work in C#?",
      "answer": "The virtual keyword is used to mark a method as overridable. The override keyword is used to provide a different implementation of a method that is already provided by a superclass. The new keyword is used to hide a method of a superclass."

    },
    {
      "question": "Why do we need constructors?",
      "answer": "Constructors are used to initialize objects with the necessary data and to perform any other setup that is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the different types of constructors in C#?",
      "answer": "There are two types of constructors in C#: default constructors and parameterized constructors. A default constructor is a constructor with no parameters, while a parameterized constructor is a constructor with one or more parameters."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a default constructor and a parameterized constructor?",
      "answer": "A default constructor is a constructor with no parameters, while a parameterized constructor is a constructor with one or more parameters."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a copy constructor? How is it implemented in C#?",
      "answer": "A copy constructor is a constructor that takes an object of the same type as a parameter and creates a copy of it. It is implemented in C# using the following syntax: public MyClass(MyClass other) { ... }"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a static constructor? When is it called?",
      "answer": "A static constructor is a constructor that is used to initialize static fields. It is called when the class is loaded."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can a constructor be private? Where is it useful?",
      "answer": "Yes, a constructor can be private. It is useful when we want to prevent other classes from creating instances of our class."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is constructor overloading? How does it work in C#?",
      "answer": "Constructor overloading is a process by which a class provides multiple definitions for a constructor with the same name but different parameters. It is implemented in C# using the following syntax: public MyClass(int x) { ... } public MyClass(int x, int y) { ... }"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can we make a constructor optional in C#?",
      "answer": "We can make a constructor optional in C# by providing a default value for each parameter. For example: public MyClass(int x = 0, int y = 0) { ... }"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a destructor in C#?",
      "answer": "A destructor is a special type of method that is used to clean up resources when an object is destroyed."
    },

      "question": "When is a destructor called in C#?",
      "answer": "A destructor is called when an object is destroyed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between a destructor and the Dispose method?",
      "answer": "A destructor is called when an object is destroyed, while the Dispose method is called when an object is no longer needed."

    {
      "question": "Can a destructor be overloaded?",
      "answer": "No, a destructor cannot be overloaded."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does C# not support destructors like C++?",
      "answer": "C# does not support destructors like C++ because it uses the garbage collector to manage memory. The garbage collector is responsible for cleaning up resources when an object is no longer needed, so there is no need for destructors."

      "question": "What is the difference between public, private, protected, and internal?",
      "answer": "Public members are accessible from anywhere, private members are accessible only from within the same class, protected members are accessible only from within the same class and its derived classes, and internal members are accessible only from within the same assembly."
    },
